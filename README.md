[![Demo](screenshots/elm3dgamejam.png)](http://unsoundscapes.com/elm-webgl-playground/elm3dgamejam.html)

[Elm Game Jam #5](https://itch.io/jam/elm-game-jam-5) logo rendering, designed by @kuzminadya. Uses:

* [elm-obj-file](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/w0rm/elm-obj-file/latest]/) to load the "3D" mesh, that was created in Blender
* [one-true-path-experiment](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/folkertdev/one-true-path-experiment/latest/) to parse the SVG path and [elm-geometry](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-geometry/latest/) and
[elm-triangular-mesh](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-triangular-mesh/latest/) to generate the tube-shaped mesh of the lettering
* Rendered with [elm-3d-scene](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene/latest/)

## shadowvolume.elm

Real-time shadows using the shadow volume technique.

## osloelmday.elm

A demo similar to Oslo Elm Day 2019, but implemented in Elm instead of Three.js.

## circle.elm

Draws a circle in the fragment shader.

## shadertoy.elm

Renders the shader code from [https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1) using Elm WebGL.

## css3d.elm

Mixes WebGL and DOM layers in one common 3D space.

[![Demo](screenshots/css3d.gif)](http://unsoundscapes.com/elm-webgl-playground/css3d.html)

The front face of the cube is rendered with a transparent color. This makes
a part of the canvas transparent so the DOM element can be seen through it.

Native module had to be used in order to extract the values from `Mat4`.

## tangram.elm

Elm tangram pieces in 3D, composing different logos of Elm-related projects.

## copter3d.elm

I found a copter model, that we had modeled together with a schoolmate using just pen and paper when we were kids back in 2002. This used to be rendered with Direct3D in Visual Basic. I converted the model into Elm and WebGL.

## planet3d.elm

[Demo](http://unsoundscapes.com/elm-webgl-playground/planet3d.html)

Generates a planet with randomized surface. In this demo I also tried to add lightning to the scene.

## animation2d.elm

I couldn't find any simple example of how to render 2D
with WebGL and Elm, so I decided to create this myself.

This renders an animated object at the mouse position:

Special thanks to [Kolja](https://github.com/kolja) for the awesome illustration.
